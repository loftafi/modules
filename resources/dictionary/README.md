# Dictionary

This is a list of known Ancient Greek vocabulary items and their associated
forms as they can be found Greek text.

An attempt has been made to map strongs numbers to the data. In some cases
multiple strongs numbers map to a single word or a single strongs number
maps to multiple words.

Glosses have been appled to a subset of these words and their associated
forms. The word 'λύω' may have the gloss 'untie' and the associated form
'λύει' may have the specific glosses 'he unties, she unties.'

## Sources

The glosses have two primary sources. The original glosses were looseley
based upon strongs glosses. Many improvements
and additions have been made:

 - Updating glosses that contain English that is not common
   in modern English usage.
 - Glosses for Ancient Greek grammar terminology based upon the ancient
   source "The Art of Grammar" by Dionysius Thrax.
 - Addition of new glosses for words often found in beginner Ancient Greek
   and Biblical Greek beginner practice reading materials.
